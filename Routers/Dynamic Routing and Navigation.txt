Dynamic Routing and Navigation


(i) 
Dynamic Routing 

eg u dont know how many CHILDREN pgs will be there 

So,

1.

-> define a common basic page
-> path it as "/products/:id" 
   &
   element as "<ProductInfo/>" (in createBrowserRouter)

HERE

-> ':' is the dynamic routing 
means any PATH as "/products/<anySTRING>" will render ProductInfo page.

2.
->Define the COMMON PAGE
-> u dont know what page is it right?
-> get it from the PATH, how?

-> useParams -------> Hook

HOW TO USE:

in COMMON PAGE

import {useParams} from "react-router-dom"

const <COMMONPAGE> = () => {

    const params = useParams();
  return (
    <div>ProductInfo
        <p>{params.id}</p>         {//---> render id as defined in CBR}
    </div>
  )
}

3.

HOW TO RENDER ALL THE DYNAMIC CONTENT IN THE CHILD PAGE ?

->API CALL OR MANUALL(for example)

->once ARRAY IS EXTRACTED,
   in PARENT PAGE use map as

EG:

return (
    <>
    <ul>
      {arr.map((x)=>(
        <li>
          <Link to={`/prod/${x.id}`}>{`${x.id} : ${x.name}`}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
    </>
  )

NOTE: Here i additionally also provided it with a link to make it clickable


IMP NOTE (else lead to MISTAKE) : 
-> PATH === always absolutely defined
-> to link is dynamic and made via `...${..}`

(ii)

useNavigate ----->Hook

USE CASE: Mainly to automatically redirect user to some page

eg:

SAY in HOME:

import {useNavigate} from "react-router-dom"

function helper(){
    navigate("/products");
}

return <button onClick={helper}>Products</button>;

OR

return <button onClick={() => (navi("/products"))}>Products</button>;
}



NOTE: Here to be used based upon the user click but in general application would be

-> After Login Go TO Main PAGE , etc
