REDUX

Introduction to Redux

Function of REDUX === Function of useContext  (for APP WIDE STATE like userAuth)

BUT, 

useContext has some disadvantages!

- Long provider
  i.e. declaring and passing all the function and states,
- Nested provider
  i.e. multipled provider recursively inside the provider
- Not optimized for states which CHANGES TOO FREQUENTLY!


Thus Redux -> State Management


1.

Central App state (central store)

2.

Components access store via subscription

-components change store state via Reducer Function (NOT useReducer)
--as {state,action} coming from component while being Dispatched
